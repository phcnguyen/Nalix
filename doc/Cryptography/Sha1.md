# Sha1 Class Documentation

The `Sha1` class provides an optimized implementation of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm. SHA-1 produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value and is considered weak due to known vulnerabilities but is still used in legacy systems. This implementation processes data in 512-bit (64-byte) blocks. This class is part of the `Notio.Cryptography.Hash` namespace.

## Namespace

```csharp
using System;
using System.Buffers.Binary;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;
using System.Runtime.Intrinsics;
using System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86;
```

## Class Definition

### Summary

The `Sha1` class provides methods for computing SHA-1 hashes in an optimized manner. It processes data in 512-bit (64-byte) blocks, maintaining an internal state and supporting incremental updates.

```csharp
namespace Notio.Cryptography.Hash
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides an optimized implementation of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value.
    /// It is considered weak due to known vulnerabilities but is still used in legacy systems.
    /// This implementation processes data in 512-bit (64-byte) blocks.
    /// </remarks>
    public static class Sha1
    {
        // Class implementation...
    }
}
```

## Properties

### K

```csharp
public static readonly uint[] K;
```

- **Description**: The initial hash values (H0-H4) as defined in the SHA-1 specification. These values are used as the starting state of the hash computation.

### RoundConstants

```csharp
public static readonly uint[] RoundConstants;
```

- **Description**: The SHA-1 round constants used in the message expansion and compression functions. There are four constants corresponding to different rounds of the SHA-1 process:
  - `0x5A827999` for rounds 0-19
  - `0x6ED9EBA1` for rounds 20-39
  - `0x8F1BBCDC` for rounds 40-59
  - `0xCA62C1D6` for rounds 60-79

## Methods

### ComputeHash

```csharp
public static byte[] ComputeHash(ReadOnlySpan<byte> data);
```

- **Description**: Computes the SHA-1 hash of the provided data.
- **Parameters**:
  - `data`: The input data to hash.
- **Returns**: The SHA-1 hash as a 20-byte array.
- **Exceptions**:
  - `ArgumentException`: Thrown if the input data is excessively large (greater than 2^61 bytes), as SHA-1 uses a 64-bit length field.
- **Remarks**: This method follows the standard SHA-1 padding and processing rules:
  - The input data is processed in 64-byte blocks.
  - A padding byte `0x80` is added after the data.
  - The length of the original message (in bits) is appended in big-endian format.

## Example Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the `Sha1` class:

```csharp
using Notio.Cryptography.Hash;

public class Example
{
    public void ComputeHashExample()
    {
        byte[] data = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello, World!");
        byte[] hash = Sha1.ComputeHash(data);
        Console.WriteLine(BitConverter.ToString(hash).Replace("-", "").ToLower());
    }
}
```

## Remarks

The `Sha1` class is designed to provide a highly optimized implementation of the SHA-1 hash algorithm. It ensures efficient processing of data and supports incremental updates, making it suitable for various cryptographic applications.
